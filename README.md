Group Introduction of the day
# Randomly Pick A `React Coder` Member from List
## IDEA: for react coders intro

let's create a tiny project to intro our members by picking their numbers randomly and ask them for introduction.
 
- Read members from members list (It could be a text files too or properties).  
> 
> active members list
>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tP4LBFUagjoNa_6Peao2K4sowdaOUXrDHd1TsGVkRvE/edit?usp=sharing

- Push app code on repo and on surge URL so that app can be publicly accessible for all
- App pick a random react coder member number and call for introduction
#### "[INTRODUCTION OF THE DAY]" 
##### Mention +92 3323967 and ask for full introduction
- Mention number on group whoever is that and ask for Introduction.
- Remove those whose introduction has been done or number picked by app.

- Pushed code and It will look like this. Please improve UI and logics more if you see any issue in code before we create a public link.
