always:
try {
    your best and;
    do {
        what you need to do;
    } while{ you still have the time };
    for (opportunity; comes; only once) {
        so grab the chance
    }
if(you fail)
throw "all your worries"
} catch (yourself) {
    everytime you fail;
    and you know to Whom
    you should goto always;
}
finally{
    You will succeed;
}
Happy Birthday To You
